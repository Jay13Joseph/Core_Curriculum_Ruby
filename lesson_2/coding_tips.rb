1. use clear names
2. use snake_case, except classes, which are CamelCase,
   or constants, which are UPPERCASE
3. DO NOT mutate constants
4. Methods should only do ONE thing, and be about 10 lines, max
5. Decide whether the method should return a value with no side effects or
  perform side effects with no return value.
  If you do both, you probably won't remember what the method does when you need to use it.
6. Take an input and return an output.
  You should be able to copy and paste method into irb.
7. Same level of abrtraction.
  deal()
  hit()
  stay()
  iterate_through_cards() # programmers concern

# Revisit Methods and Methods should be at the same level of abstraction sections
